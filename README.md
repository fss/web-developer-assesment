# Web Developer assesment project

Goal of the assesment is to create a web application that:
1. Draws Poland map using OpenStreetMap (https://www.openstreetmap.org/)
2. Fetches the current weather data from IMGW (https://danepubliczne.imgw.pl/apiinfo)
3. For all the stations, fetches the station geolocation (usage of any public API is allowed) and puts the temperature marker on the map (no fancy styling needed here)
4. For all the stations we get current temperature and based on that we draw temperature overlays in a similar (not necessarily the same) fashion that Windy does (https://www.windy.com/). WebGL / gradients aren't mandatory, but of course will be considered extra
